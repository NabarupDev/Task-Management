## 📌 About the Project  
The **Task Management App** is a **React**-based project designed to manage and track tasks. It allows users to add, view, and organize tasks in a simple and user-friendly interface. Built with **React** and **Vite**, the app does not have a backend but stores data temporarily in the browser. Tasks can be marked as completed, and users can see their current tasks and explore the app's sections (Home, About, and Tasks).
